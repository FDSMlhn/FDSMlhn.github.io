## Introduction:

This is the personal blog for learning purpose. Ocassionally, I will post some passages relevant to machine learning. There is one post for now:

10.22.17 [Derivation of Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) - Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)](https://fdsmlhn.github.io/2017/10/22/Derivation%20of%20Back%20Propagation%20Through%20Time%20(BPTT)%20-%20Vanilla%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Network(RNN)/)

Hope it helps you save your time.
